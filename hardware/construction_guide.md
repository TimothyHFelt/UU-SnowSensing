# Construction Guide

This guide provides instructions for constructing the deployment platform for a snow sensing station including the mast and sensor crossarm that will support the sensors, enclosures, solar panels, etc. This document provides instructions for construction of a mast that does not use Campbell Scientific hardware and describes how to assemble sensors and enclosures. If you choose to use a Campbell Scientific tripod, its setup is not discussed in this repository. You will however want to use this guide for all other construction for your station (e.g., sensor crossarm, enclosure mounting, etc.).
