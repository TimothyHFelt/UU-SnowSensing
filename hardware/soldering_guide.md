# Soldering Guide

This guide walks through the soldering requirements for components of the snow sensing station that are not already soldered together when you purchase them. It includes instructions for soldering the components of the additional analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) needed for making longwave radiation measurements and the MaxBotix sonar sensor.  
An optional soldering jumper setting on the Mayfly is also discussed.
